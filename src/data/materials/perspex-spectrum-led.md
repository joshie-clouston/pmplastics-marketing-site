## Maximum Impact LED Signage

Perspex Spectrum LED is a specialist cast acrylic sheet designed for the sign-making market. It combines bold, intense colour in daylight with even, consistent illumination when backlit by white LEDs — creating evenly illuminated signs with a slim profile, free from hot spots.

The white light formula is specifically optimised for white LED sources, ensuring colour accuracy and diffusion performance that standard acrylics cannot match.

## Available Colours

Eleven colours are available, covering the most popular corporate imaging hues:

- Opal (two variants)
- Yellow (two variants)
- Orange
- Pink
- Red (two variants)
- Green (two variants)
- Blue

## The Right Specification

Perspex Spectrum LED is purpose-built for modern LED signage. Standard acrylic sheets may allow LED hot spots to show through, particularly in slim-profile sign boxes. The Spectrum LED range solves this with superior diffusion, letting you build thinner, lighter signs with consistent illumination.

## Typical Applications

Perspex Spectrum LED is used for internal and external signage, point-of-purchase displays, directional systems, interior design features, and architectural lighting applications where LED backlighting demands even colour diffusion.
