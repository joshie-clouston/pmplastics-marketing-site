## Gold Coast Thermoforming Services

P&M Plastics provides thermoforming services from our Burleigh Heads facility, with Australia-wide shipping available. Thermoforming is one of the oldest methods of shaping and fabricating plastics into different shapes and useful products — and it remains one of the most versatile.

## How Thermoforming Works

The process heats thermoplastic material until it reaches a pre-set melt flow index, at which point the material can be draped and formed over a tool or mould while clamped in position. This delivers consistent, repeatable shapes across production runs.

## Materials

We thermoform a range of thermoplastic materials:

- Acrylic
- Perspex
- High Impact Acrylic
- Polyethylene
- Polypropylene
- ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)
- ASA (Acrylic Styrene Acrylonitrile)

## Thin-Gauge Thermoforming

Thin-gauge thermoforming is ideal for high-volume, lightweight products:

- Plastic and disposable cups
- Food packaging containers and lids
- Scoops
- Seedling tubes
- General tubs
- Trays
- Blister packs

## Thick-Gauge Thermoforming

Thick-gauge thermoforming produces robust, structural components:

- Panels
- Liners
- Plastic pallets

## Capabilities

- **Half-sphere production:** 50 mm to 2000 mm diameter
- **Maximum component size:** up to 3 x 2.5 metres
- **Multiple thermoforming ovens** with various jig and plate sizes

## Tooling and Prototyping

- **Prototypes** — wood or MDF tools manufactured in-house using our 3D CNC routers
- **Production tooling** — manufactured from fibreglass or aluminium epoxy for long-run durability

## Why Choose Thermoforming?

Thermoforming is fast, cost-effective, and highly versatile compared to other plastic fabrication methods. Thermoformed plastics can also be recycled depending on the material used, making it an environmentally conscious choice for many applications.
