## Perspex Sheet vs Lexan Polycarbonate Sheet — Which Should You Choose?

Two of the most commonly requested materials at P&M Plastics are Perspex (cast acrylic) and Lexan (polycarbonate). Both are transparent thermoplastics used as alternatives to glass, but they have distinctly different properties that make each one better suited to certain applications.

This guide breaks down the key differences to help you make the right choice for your project.

### What Is Perspex?

Perspex is an internationally renowned brand of cast acrylic sheet, first developed in 1934. It is a rigid, transparent thermoplastic with exceptional optical clarity, UV stability, and weather resistance. Perspex is manufactured in an extensive range of colours and finishes, and clear Perspex carries a 30-year warranty.

### What Is Lexan?

Lexan is a leading brand of polycarbonate sheet. Polycarbonate is an extremely tough, impact-resistant thermoplastic — up to 250 times stronger than glass. It is widely used in applications requiring high impact resistance, such as machine guards, security glazing, and safety barriers.

### Head-to-Head Comparison

| Property | Perspex (Acrylic) | Lexan (Polycarbonate) |
|---|---|---|
| Impact strength vs glass | ~17x stronger | ~250x stronger |
| Light transmission (clear) | ~92% | ~88% |
| UV resistance | Excellent — inherent UV stability | Requires UV-stabilised coating; uncoated grades yellow over time |
| Scratch resistance | Good — harder surface | Lower — softer surface, more prone to scratching |
| Flammability | Combustible | Self-extinguishing |
| Deflection temperature | 75-100 °C | ~130 °C |
| Continuous service temp | 50 °C | ~120 °C |
| Specific gravity | 1.19 | 1.20 |
| Chemical resistance | Resistant to most household chemicals; incompatible with solvents | Resistant to dilute acids and many chemicals; incompatible with strong alkalis and some solvents |
| Cost | Lower | Higher |
| Warranty (clear) | 30 years (Perspex branded) | Varies by supplier |

### When to Choose Perspex

Perspex is the better choice when:

- **Optical clarity matters** — Perspex transmits more light and provides a clearer view than polycarbonate
- **UV exposure is constant** — Perspex is inherently UV-stable and will not yellow over time, making it ideal for outdoor signage, skylights, and pool fencing
- **Scratch resistance is important** — Perspex has a harder surface and is more resistant to everyday scratching
- **Budget is a factor** — Perspex is generally more cost-effective than polycarbonate
- **Colour range matters** — the Perspex collection includes dozens of colours, tints, and specialty finishes

**Common Perspex applications:** Signage, retail displays, pool fence panels, skylights, architectural panels, splashbacks, furniture, and decorative features.

### When to Choose Lexan Polycarbonate

Lexan is the better choice when:

- **Extreme impact resistance is required** — polycarbonate is virtually unbreakable, making it the material of choice for security glazing, machine guards, and protective barriers
- **Fire resistance matters** — polycarbonate is self-extinguishing, whereas acrylic is combustible
- **High temperatures are involved** — polycarbonate has a much higher continuous service temperature (120 °C vs 50 °C)
- **Flexibility is needed** — polycarbonate can be cold-formed to tighter radii than acrylic without cracking

**Common Lexan applications:** Machine guards, safety glazing, security screens, riot shields, greenhouses, carport roofing, and high-traffic protective barriers.

### Can You Use Both in the Same Project?

Yes. It is common to use Perspex where appearance and clarity are the priority, and polycarbonate where impact resistance and safety are paramount. For example, a retail environment might use Perspex for display cases and polycarbonate for security barriers.

### Fabrication Considerations

Both materials can be laser cut, CNC routed, thermoformed, and machined. However, there are some differences in how they behave during fabrication:

- **Laser cutting** — Perspex laser cuts beautifully with a flame-polished edge. Polycarbonate tends to produce a rougher edge and may discolour during laser cutting.
- **Thermoforming** — Both materials can be vacuum formed, but polycarbonate requires higher forming temperatures.
- **Gluing** — Perspex is easily solvent-welded with excellent joint clarity. Polycarbonate requires specialist adhesives and is more difficult to bond with a clear finish.
- **Bending** — Polycarbonate can be cold-bent to tighter radii. Perspex requires heat bending for most curves.

### Our Recommendation

For most domestic and commercial applications — signage, displays, pool fencing, skylights, and decorative panels — **Perspex is the better all-round choice**. It looks better, costs less, and lasts longer in UV-exposed environments.

For applications demanding maximum impact resistance or fire performance — machine guards, security glazing, and industrial safety barriers — **Lexan polycarbonate is the clear winner**.
