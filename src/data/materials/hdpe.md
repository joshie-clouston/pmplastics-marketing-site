## What Is HDPE?

HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) is a very rigid material used in general plant engineering, tank construction, and wastewater industries where all-round chemical resistance and weatherability are required.

## Key Properties

- **Impact resistance:** Good
- **Mechanical strength:** High
- **Abrasion resistance:** Excellent
- **Electrical insulation:** Very good
- **Damping properties:** Very high
- **Continuous use temperature:** -45 to 100 degrees C
- **Water absorption:** Minimal (0.01%)

## Chemical Resistance

**Compatible with:** Acids, salts, salt solutions, alcohols, oils, fats, waxes, and many solvents.

**Incompatible with:** Strong oxidising agents and halogenated hydrocarbons (cause swelling or degradation).

## UV Resistance

- **White:** Non-UV resistant
- **Black:** UV protected — suitable for outdoor use

## Available Sizes

### Sheet

**Standard sheet size:** 3000 x 1500 mm

**Thickness options (White and Black):** 1.5, 3, 4.5, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30 mm

### Rod

**Colour:** Black only

- **2 m lengths:** 25–75 mm diameters
- **1 m lengths:** 80–100 mm diameters
- **0.5 m lengths:** 110–150 mm diameters

## Applications

HDPE is commonly used for machine guards, [custom liquid transport tanks](/products/custom-liquid-transport-tanks), chemical tanks, cutting boards, pipe fittings, and component parts.

## Cut-to-Size Service

We offer cut-to-size services for both sheet and rod. Rod minimum cuts: 25–45 mm requires full length; 50 mm+ minimum 500 mm cut. Contact us for a quote.
