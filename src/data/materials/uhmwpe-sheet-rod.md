## What Is UHMWPE?

UHMWPE (Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene) is a premium engineering plastic with the highest abrasion resistance and impact strength of any thermoplastic. Its exceptionally long molecular chains give it superior wear properties, making it the material of choice for high-wear, high-impact industrial applications.

## Key Properties

- **Abrasion resistance:** Superior — highest of any thermoplastic
- **Impact strength:** Excellent — even at very low temperatures
- **Friction:** Very low coefficient of friction — self-lubricating
- **Chemical resistance:** High — resists most chemicals and solvents
- **Water absorption:** Very low (0.01%)
- **Continuous use temperature:** -200 to 80 degrees C
- **Specific gravity:** 0.93
- **Noise dampening:** Excellent vibration absorption
- **Food safety:** FDA approved

## Chemical Resistance

**Compatible with:** Most acids, alkalis, alcohols, oils, fuels, and solvents.

**Incompatible with:** Strong oxidising acids at elevated temperatures.

## Available Sizes

### Sheet

**Standard sheet sizes:** 1000 x 2000 mm and 1000 x 3000 mm

**Thickness options:** 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 mm

**Colours:** Natural (white), Black, Green

### Rod

**Colour:** Natural (white) and Black

**Diameter range:** 20 mm to 200 mm in various standard lengths

## Applications

UHMWPE is commonly used for wear strips and guides, conveyor components, chute and hopper liners, [marine](/industries/marine) components, food processing equipment, and dock fenders.
