## Museum-Grade UV Protection

Perspex VA and VE Gallery Grade are specialised acrylic sheets designed for UV-sensitive applications. Both grades absorb harmful ultraviolet radiation while maintaining outstanding optical clarity — protecting valuable exhibits, artwork, and displays from UV damage.

### VE Grade — Maximum UV Protection

Perspex VE absorbs **99.99% of all incident UV light**, making it the premier choice for museums, art galleries, and archival environments where UV-sensitive items require the highest level of protection.

### VA Grade — High UV Protection

Perspex VA absorbs **95% of UV light under 400nm**, making it well suited for lighting fixtures with mercury vapour lamps and other applications where strong UV filtering is needed.
