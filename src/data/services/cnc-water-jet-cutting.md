## Precision Water Jet Cutting Services

P&M Plastics offers CNC water jet cutting services from our Gold Coast facility in Burleigh Heads, with Australia-wide shipping available. Water jet cutting uses a high-pressure stream of water — often mixed with an abrasive garnet — to cut through virtually any material with extreme precision.

Unlike laser or thermal cutting methods, water jet cutting produces no heat-affected zone, meaning material properties remain unchanged right up to the cut edge. This makes it ideal for heat-sensitive materials, thick sections, and applications where edge quality is critical.

## Materials We Cut

Water jet cutting is one of the most versatile cutting methods available, capable of handling:

- **Plastics** — acrylic, Perspex, polycarbonate, HDPE, PVC, nylon, UHMWPE, and more
- **Metals** — aluminium, stainless steel, mild steel, copper, brass, and titanium
- **Stone and composite** — marble, granite, ceramic tile, and composite panels
- **Timber** — MDF, plywood, and solid hardwoods
- **Rubber and foam** — gaskets, seals, and packaging

## Key Advantages

- **No heat distortion** — cold-cutting process preserves material integrity
- **Any shape** — CNC control allows intricate profiles, text, and complex geometries
- **Tight tolerances** — consistent accuracy across production runs
- **Minimal kerf** — narrow cut width reduces material waste
- **No secondary finishing** — clean edge quality straight off the machine
- **Thick materials** — capable of cutting material thicknesses that exceed laser and router limits

## How It Works

Our CNC-controlled water jet system uses CAD software to drive the cutting head along your design path. Simply provide your design files (EPS, AI, CDR, DXF, DWG, IGS, or PDF) or send us a JPEG with dimensions for quoting purposes.

We handle everything from one-off prototypes to long production runs, and we ship Australia-wide.
