## Miscellaneous Projects Gallery

Beyond our core product lines, P&M Plastics regularly takes on unique, one-off, and custom projects that don't fit neatly into a single category. This gallery showcases the diversity of work our team handles — from creative prototypes to problem-solving engineering solutions.

### Types of Projects

- **Custom prototypes** — one-off parts and proof-of-concept builds for inventors, designers, and engineers
- **Replacement components** — reverse-engineered plastic parts for machinery, vehicles, and equipment where originals are no longer available
- **Domestic projects** — custom shelving, splashbacks, pet enclosures, hobby builds, and household items fabricated from acrylic, polycarbonate, and PVC
- **Art and creative installations** — laser-cut and engraved acrylic artworks, light features, and sculptural elements for artists and interior designers
- **Electrical and plumbing components** — custom switchboard covers, cable management solutions, and pipe fittings
- **Food service equipment** — custom food guards, serving trays, and dispensing components for cafes and restaurants
- **Furniture components** — acrylic tabletops, chair arm rests, and decorative furniture inserts
- **Laser-engraved products** — personalised gifts, awards, nameplates, and branded merchandise

### Materials

We work across the full range of plastic materials, including acrylic, Perspex, polycarbonate, PVC, HDPE, polypropylene, PETG, HIPS, nylon, PTFE, UHMWPE, foam PVC, Corflute, and aluminium composite panels.

### Our Approach

No project is too small or too unusual. If it involves plastic and you need it made right, bring it to us. We'll assess your requirements, recommend the best material and manufacturing approach, and deliver a finished product that meets your specifications.
