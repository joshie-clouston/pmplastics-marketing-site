## Thermomix Mat — Clear Perspex

Do not drag your Thermomix on the benchtop — this will damage your scales. Use a Perspex mat to safely move the machine around and prevent damage to both the appliance and your surfaces.

### Specifications

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| Material | 2mm clear Perspex |
| Dimensions | 350 x 300mm |
| Corner radius | 10mm radiused corners |

### Why You Need One

Thermomix machines rely on precision scales built into the base. Dragging the unit across a benchtop can knock the scales out of calibration and scratch your surfaces. This clear Perspex mat sits beneath the machine, allowing you to slide it smoothly without risk of damage.

### Features

- **Clear and discreet** — virtually invisible on your benchtop
- **Smooth base** — glides easily across most surfaces
- **Radiused corners** — no sharp edges for safe handling
- **Easy to clean** — wipe down with a soft cloth
