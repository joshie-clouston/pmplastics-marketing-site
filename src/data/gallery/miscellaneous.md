## Miscellaneous Projects Gallery

Beyond our core product lines, P&M Plastics regularly takes on unique, one-off, and custom projects that don't fit neatly into a single category. This gallery showcases the diversity of work our team handles — from creative prototypes to problem-solving engineering solutions.

### Types of Projects

- **Custom prototypes** — one-off parts and proof-of-concept builds for inventors, designers, and engineers
- **Replacement components** — reverse-engineered plastic parts for machinery, vehicles, and equipment where originals are no longer available
- **[Domestic](/industries/domestic) projects** — custom shelving, splashbacks, pet enclosures, hobby builds, and household items fabricated from [acrylic](/materials/acrylic-sheet), [polycarbonate](/materials/polycarbonate), and [PVC](/materials/pvc-sheet)
- **Art and creative installations** — [laser-cut](/services/cnc-laser-cutting) and engraved acrylic artworks, light features, and sculptural elements for artists and interior designers
- **Electrical and plumbing components** — custom switchboard covers, cable management solutions, and pipe fittings
- **Food service equipment** — custom food guards, serving trays, and dispensing components for cafes and restaurants
- **Furniture components** — acrylic tabletops, chair arm rests, and decorative furniture inserts
- **Laser-engraved products** — personalised gifts, awards, nameplates, and branded merchandise
