## Industrial Plastic Fabrication

From machining High Density Polyethylene ([HDPE](/materials/hdpe)) drive wheels for conveyors to designing plastic skirting and lining for dump truck bins that improve wear resistance and unloading speed, P&M Plastics has the ability to identify the problem and engineer a solution.

We manufacture [PVC](/materials/pvc-sheet) pipe headers and aeration tubes for sewerage treatment facilities, redesign plastic air intakes for air filtration systems, and produce high-pressure [plastic components](/products/components) for car wash stations and dust extraction systems.

### Capabilities

Using [laser cutting](/services/cnc-laser-cutting), CNC routing, and [waterjet cutting](/services/cnc-water-jet-cutting), we deliver specialised component manufacturing, fabrication, and assembly for a wide range of industrial applications.

### Industries We Serve

- Mining
- Engineering
- Electrical
- Plumbing
- Civil works

We supply industrial plastic piping assemblies for commercial projects and plastic acid tank assemblies — all manufactured from specialty plastic materials including HDPE, PVC, [Perspex](/materials/perspex)/[acrylic](/materials/acrylic-sheet), and [polycarbonate](/materials/polycarbonate).
