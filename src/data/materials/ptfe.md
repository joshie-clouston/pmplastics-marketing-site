## What Is PTFE?

PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene), commonly known by the trade name Teflon, is a high-performance fluoropolymer with the lowest coefficient of friction of any solid material. It offers virtually universal chemical resistance and operates across an extraordinarily wide temperature range.

## Key Properties

- **Friction:** Lowest coefficient of friction of any plastic (0.05–0.10)
- **Chemical resistance:** Virtually universal — resists almost all chemicals
- **Temperature range:** -200 to +260 degrees C continuous use
- **Electrical insulation:** Excellent dielectric properties
- **Non-stick:** Exceptional non-stick surface
- **Water absorption:** Nil (0.00%)
- **Specific gravity:** 2.15
- **Flame resistance:** Non-flammable
- **Food safety:** FDA approved

## Chemical Resistance

PTFE is resistant to virtually all chemicals, solvents, and corrosive environments. The only substances that attack PTFE are molten alkali metals and fluorine gas at elevated temperatures.

## Available Sizes

### Sheet

**Standard sheet sizes:** 300 x 300 mm, 600 x 600 mm, and 1200 x 1200 mm

**Thickness options:** 1.5, 2, 3, 4.5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25 mm

**Colour:** Natural (white)

### Rod

**Colour:** Natural (white)

**Diameter range:** 6 mm to 200 mm in various standard lengths

## Applications

PTFE is widely used for chemical processing equipment, gaskets and seals, bearings and bushings, electrical insulation, food processing equipment, and laboratory equipment.
