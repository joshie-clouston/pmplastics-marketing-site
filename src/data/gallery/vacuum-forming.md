## Vacuum Forming Gallery

P&M Plastics operates CNC vacuum forming equipment capable of producing consistent, high-quality thermoformed components for OEM and custom applications. Our vacuum forming service is one of the most versatile manufacturing processes we offer — turning flat plastic sheet into complex three-dimensional shapes over custom moulds.

### Featured Projects

Our vacuum forming portfolio includes:

- **Marine consoles and glove boxes** — UV-resistant vacuum-formed driving consoles and glove boxes supplied to OEM boat builders across Australia
- **Automotive components** — dashboard trims, interior panels, and custom enclosures for vehicles and buses
- **Point-of-sale displays** — moulded product trays, display housings, and promotional stands for major retailers including K-Mart, Woolworths, and Coles
- **Industrial enclosures** — equipment housings, machine covers, and protective guards thermoformed from engineering-grade plastics
- **Signage components** — formed sign faces, channel letters, and illuminated sign housings
- **Medical and food-grade trays** — precision-formed trays and containers for healthcare and food processing

### Materials

We vacuum form a wide range of thermoplastics, including:

- **ABS** — tough, impact-resistant, and easy to paint
- **HIPS (High Impact Polystyrene)** — cost-effective for large production runs
- **Acrylic** — crystal-clear optical quality
- **PETG** — food-safe, chemical-resistant, and easy to thermoform
- **Polycarbonate** — virtually unbreakable for demanding environments
- **PVC** — chemical-resistant and flame-retardant

### Process

Flat plastic sheet is heated to forming temperature, then drawn over a custom mould using vacuum pressure. The result is a precise, repeatable part with consistent wall thickness and detail. We manufacture moulds in-house, allowing rapid prototyping and short lead times from concept to production.
