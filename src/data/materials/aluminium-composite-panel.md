## What Is Aluminium Composite Panel?

Aluminium Composite Material (ACM/ACP) is a decorative panel used increasingly by developers, designers, and architects worldwide for building and signage applications. It features a three-layer sandwich construction for maximum strength at minimum weight.

## Construction

1. **Top aluminium sheet:** Coated with polyester or PVDF paint for durability and finish
2. **Polyethylene core:** Available in standard or FR (Fire-Resistant) variant
3. **Bottom aluminium sheet:** Mill finish or polyester paint backing (6–8 um thickness)

## Key Properties

- **Weight:** Lightweight compared to solid aluminium
- **Insulation:** Good heat and sound insulation
- **Weather resistance:** Weatherproof
- **Fire resistance:** FR variant available with special fire-resistant treatment
- **Maintenance:** Minimal upkeep required
- **Installation:** Simple to install and fabricate

## Available Sizes

**Standard panel:** 1220 x 2440 mm

**Additional sizes:** 1500 x 3000 mm, 1500 x 4000 mm, 3660 x 1500 mm

**Thickness options:** 2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm

**Colours:** Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Mill Aluminium, Brushed Aluminium, Silver, Gold Mirror

## Applications

Aluminium composite panel is widely used in architecture (ceilings, wall linings, partitions), display and external signage, transport (trailers, buses, marine and rail), and building cladding.
