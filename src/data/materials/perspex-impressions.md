## A New Dimension in Acrylic Design

Perspex Impressions Linear adds a completely new aspect to the Perspex brand. The sophisticated linear pattern enhances the sheet's appearance by adding design and texture to the surface, created for designers, architects, brands, retailers, and shop fitters.

Each sheet features a **unique gloss finish on one side and a textured linear pattern on the other**, giving designers the flexibility to use either side depending on the application.

The pattern is integral to the sheet — it cannot be rubbed or scratched off.
