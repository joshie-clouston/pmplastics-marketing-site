## What Are Skylight Diffusers?

Skylight diffusers are translucent plastic panels designed to replace damaged or aged skylight glazing. Available in opal and prismatic finishes, they provide even light distribution while blocking harmful UV radiation and reducing heat gain.

## Key Properties

- **Light diffusion:** Even distribution — eliminates harsh sunlight and shadows
- **UV protection:** UV stabilised for long-term outdoor performance
- **Weather resistance:** Weatherproof — designed for roof-level exposure
- **Impact resistance:** Significantly stronger than glass
- **Weight:** Lightweight — easy to handle and install
- **Lifespan:** Long-lasting with minimal yellowing or degradation

## Available Options

### Opal Diffusers
- Soft, uniform light diffusion
- Available in acrylic and polycarbonate
- Ideal for residential and commercial skylights

### Prismatic Diffusers
- Maximum light transmission with glare control
- Textured prismatic pattern for even distribution
- Ideal for commercial and industrial applications
