## Perspex Recipe Book Holder

Every budding chef needs one of these. The frame is made from 6mm thick clear [Perspex](/materials/perspex) with a loose 3mm thick clear Perspex cover panel — your recipe book will always be well protected. Very practical and easy to clean.

### Design

- **Frame**: 6mm thick clear Perspex — sturdy and stable on any benchtop
- **Cover panel**: 3mm thick clear Perspex — removable for easy access to your recipe book
- **Construction**: Two-layer protective design that shields pages from kitchen spills and splashes

### Why Perspex?

Perspex is the ideal material for kitchen accessories. It is waterproof, easy to wipe clean, and optically clear so your recipe pages remain fully readable through the protective cover.

### How It Works

Simply place your open recipe book into the frame and slide the loose cover panel in front of the pages. The removable cover allows you to turn pages quickly, then slide it back for continued protection while you cook.
