## Plastic Fabrication Gallery

P&M Plastics has been fabricating custom plastic products on the Gold Coast for decades. This gallery showcases the breadth of our general fabrication capabilities — from simple cut-to-size panels to complex multi-component assemblies.

### Fabrication Capabilities

Our in-house capabilities include:

- **CNC Laser Cutting** — precision cuts in acrylic, Perspex, polycarbonate, MDF, plywood, and thin metals with tolerances to fractions of a millimetre
- **CNC Router Cutting** — intricate 2D and 3D machining across a wide range of sheet materials and engineering plastics
- **CNC Water Jet Cutting** — cuts virtually any material into any shape, including thick plastics, metals, stone, and composites
- **CNC Vacuum Forming** — thermoforming over custom moulds for consistent production of three-dimensional parts
- **Plastic Thermoforming** — heat bending and shaping of thermoplastics using specialised ovens
- **Plastic Welding** — hot air and solvent welding for tanks, enclosures, and structural assemblies
- **2D Laser Engraving and Etching** — detailed surface marking, branding, and labelling
- **3D Laser Engraving** — textured, dimensional engraving for high-impact visual results

### Featured Projects

- **Industrial components** — HDPE drive wheels, conveyor parts, machine guards, and pipe assemblies for mining and engineering clients
- **Marine fittings** — driving consoles, windscreens, glove boxes, and deck hardware for OEM boat builders
- **Signage and branding** — laser-cut logos, illuminated sign panels, and directional signage for retail and corporate environments
- **Architectural elements** — balustrade panels, room dividers, skylights, and decorative screening
- **Commercial products** — sneeze guards, display stands, food-grade components, and safety covers
- **Automotive parts** — dashboard trims, custom enclosures, and vehicle flooring

### Materials We Work With

Acrylic, Perspex, polycarbonate (Lexan), PVC, HDPE, polypropylene, PETG, HIPS, ABS, nylon, PTFE, UHMWPE, foam PVC, Corflute, MDF, plywood, aluminium composite panels, aluminium, steel, and stainless steel.
