## Skylight Replacement Panels — Cut to Size

P&M Plastics offers custom-cut skylight replacement panels in three high-performance materials. These UV-resistant options are the ideal replacement for cracked or yellowed skylight panels.

### Material Options

#### Opal Acrylic (Frosted White)
Softens and diffuses harsh sunlight, creating a comfortable ambient glow. UV-stabilised and weather-resistant, making it the ideal choice for bathrooms, hallways, and living spaces.

#### K12 Prismatic Diffuser
Delivers high light transmission with minimal glare. The prism pattern disperses light evenly across the room — widely used in offices, retail shops, and lightboxes.

#### Clear Acrylic
Provides high clarity for maximum daylight penetration. A lightweight glass alternative best suited to areas requiring direct, unfiltered light.

### Applications

- Flat [acrylic](/materials/acrylic-sheet) skylight covers
- Interior light diffusers
- Roof hatches
- Dome skylights (flat panel inserts)
