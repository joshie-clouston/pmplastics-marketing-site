title: "3D Laser Engraving FAQs"
description: "Frequently asked questions about 3D laser engraving at P&M Plastics — how it works, materials, applications, and the difference between 2D and 3D laser engraving on the Gold Coast."
questions:
  - question: "What is 3D laser engraving?"
    answer: "3D laser engraving creates a three-dimensional, textured surface by varying the depth of the laser engraving across the design. Unlike standard 2D engraving which produces a flat-bottomed mark, 3D engraving uses greyscale data to control the laser power at each point — resulting in contoured, sculpted surfaces with visible depth and dimension."
  - question: "How is 3D laser engraving different from 2D laser engraving?"
    answer: "2D laser engraving produces a flat, uniform-depth mark on the surface — ideal for text, logos, and line art. 3D laser engraving varies the engraving depth across the design to create a relief effect with contours, slopes, and textures. The result is a tactile, dimensional surface that catches light and casts shadows, producing a far more visually striking effect."
  - question: "What materials can be 3D laser engraved?"
    answer: "Acrylic (Perspex) is the most popular material for 3D laser engraving due to its excellent clarity and the way it responds to varying laser depths. We can also 3D engrave into timber, MDF, Corian, and selected other materials. The best results are achieved on materials that engrave cleanly and consistently across different depths."
  - question: "What are common applications for 3D laser engraving?"
    answer: "Common applications include topographic maps, architectural models, decorative wall panels, high-impact signage, awards and trophies, artistic installations, textured branding elements, point-of-sale displays, and mould patterns. 3D engraving is also used to create tactile surfaces for accessibility applications."
  - question: "What file format do you need for 3D laser engraving?"
    answer: "3D laser engraving requires a greyscale image (heightmap) where lighter areas represent shallower depths and darker areas represent deeper engraving. We accept high-resolution greyscale images in PNG, TIFF, or BMP format at a minimum of 300 DPI. We can also generate 3D heightmaps from 3D model files (STL, OBJ) or work with you to create a design from concept."
  - question: "How deep can 3D laser engraving go?"
    answer: "On acrylic, 3D engraving can achieve depths of up to approximately 5-6 mm depending on the material thickness, the number of passes, and the design. The depth is continuously variable across the design — from a light surface skim to a deep sculpted relief. We recommend discussing your specific depth requirements with our team."
  - question: "Can 3D laser engraving be backlit?"
    answer: "Yes, and this is one of the most striking applications. When 3D engraved acrylic is backlit with LEDs, the varying depths create dramatic light and shadow effects. Deeper areas glow more brightly, producing a luminous, three-dimensional appearance that is especially effective for signage, decorative panels, and artistic displays."
  - question: "What is the maximum size for 3D laser engraving?"
    answer: "Our laser bed accommodates pieces up to approximately 1200 mm x 900 mm. For larger designs, we can engrave in tiled sections and join them for a seamless result, or discuss alternative approaches to suit your project."
  - question: "How long does 3D laser engraving take?"
    answer: "3D engraving is significantly slower than 2D engraving because the laser makes multiple passes at varying power levels to build up the three-dimensional surface. A small panel may take 1-2 hours, while a large, detailed piece can take a full day or more on the machine. Turnaround time depends on job complexity, size, and our current workload."
  - question: "How much does 3D laser engraving cost?"
    answer: "3D laser engraving is priced based on the engraving area, level of detail, material, number of passes required, and machine time. It is generally more expensive than 2D engraving due to the additional time and setup involved. Contact us with your design, dimensions, and material preference for a detailed quote."
  - question: "Can you combine 3D engraving with laser cutting?"
    answer: "Absolutely. A common approach is to 3D engrave a decorative surface onto an acrylic panel and then laser cut the panel to a specific shape — producing a finished piece with both dimensional texture and a precise outline. We can also combine 3D engraving with 2D engraving for text and logos on the same piece."
