## Acrylic Opal Tube

Acrylic opal tube is purpose-built for lighting applications where even light diffusion and a clean, modern finish are critical. The opal material softens and diffuses light evenly, eliminating harsh hotspots while maintaining high light transmission for a uniform glow.

### Why Choose Opal Tube?

- **High optical quality** — professional finish for commercial lighting
- **Lightweight and strong** — impact-resistant acrylic construction
- **UV stable** — suitable for indoor and protected outdoor use
- **Modern aesthetic** — clean, contemporary appearance
