## What Is Nylon?

Nylon (Polyamide 6) is one of the most versatile engineering thermoplastics, offering an excellent combination of mechanical strength, wear resistance, and toughness. Its self-lubricating properties and high fatigue resistance make it the go-to material for gears, bearings, and wear components.

## Key Properties

- **Mechanical strength:** High tensile and compressive strength
- **Wear resistance:** Excellent — self-lubricating surface
- **Machinability:** Good — machines well on standard equipment
- **Impact strength:** Good toughness even at low temperatures
- **Fatigue resistance:** High — ideal for dynamic loading
- **Water absorption:** Moderate (1.3%) — dimensional changes possible in wet environments
- **Continuous use temperature:** -30 to 100 degrees C
- **Specific gravity:** 1.14
- **Noise dampening:** Good vibration absorption

## Chemical Resistance

**Compatible with:** Weak acids, alkalis, alcohols, oils, greases, fuels, and ketones.

**Incompatible with:** Strong mineral acids, oxidising agents, and concentrated formic acid.

**Food safety:** FDA-approved grades available.

## Available Sizes

### Sheet

**Standard sheet sizes:** 1000 x 500 mm and 1000 x 1000 mm

**Thickness options:** 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100 mm

**Colour:** Natural (cream)

### Rod

**Colour:** Natural (cream) and Black

**Diameter range:** 6 mm to 250 mm in various standard lengths

## Applications

Nylon is commonly used for gears and sprockets, bearings and bushings, rollers and wheels, wear strips and guides, conveyor components, and food processing equipment.
