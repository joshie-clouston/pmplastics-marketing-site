## What Is Prismatic Sheet?

Prismatic sheet is a light-diffusing plastic panel featuring a textured prismatic pattern on one or both surfaces. The pattern refracts and distributes light evenly, eliminating harsh glare and hot spots. It is the standard material for skylight panels, fluorescent light covers, and commercial lighting applications.

## Key Properties

- **Light distribution:** Even diffusion across the full panel area
- **Glare reduction:** Prismatic pattern eliminates harsh glare and hot spots
- **Light transmission:** High — maximises usable light output
- **Weight:** Lightweight alternative to glass
- **Impact resistance:** Good — significantly stronger than glass
- **UV stabilisation:** UV-stabilised for long-term performance

## Available Materials

Prismatic sheet is available in both **acrylic** and **polystyrene** variants:

- **Acrylic prismatic:** Higher clarity, better UV resistance, longer lifespan
- **Polystyrene prismatic:** Cost-effective option for indoor applications

## Available Sizes

**Standard sheet sizes:** 1220 x 610 mm, 1220 x 1220 mm, and 1220 x 2440 mm

**Thickness options:** 2.5 mm, 3 mm

**Pattern:** Clear prismatic — single-sided and double-sided patterns available

## Applications

Prismatic sheet is widely used for skylight panels, fluorescent light covers, commercial and industrial light fittings, architectural glazing, and display lighting.
