## Gold Coast 3D Laser Engraving Services

3D engraving creates etched goods with extra texture and impact. P&M Plastics offers 3D laser engraving and etching services to individuals and businesses on the Gold Coast, with Australia-wide shipping available.

Create complicated, custom designs using our local service to engrave characters, logos, images, and text onto a wide range of materials. Unlike 2D engraving, 3D engraving cuts into thicker materials to create a three-dimensional picture with genuine texture and depth.

## Materials

Our 3D laser engraving works across:

- **Metals** — aluminium, steel
- **Timber** — solid wood, MDF boards
- **Plastics** — acrylic and engineering plastics
- **Stone** — marble and other natural stones

## How 3D Laser Engraving Works

3D engraving is the process of etching images into materials to create three-dimensional pictures. The laser varies its depth and intensity across the design to produce genuine relief and texture — commonly used for logos, signs, personalised pictures, and more.

We highlight textures by filling black paint into lines and text, creating vivid, long-lasting pictures with real visual impact.

## Design Capabilities

We maintain a library of over 35,000 fonts and images ready to use. For custom designs, provide a vector file in EPS, AI, CDR, DXF, IGS, or PDF format, or send us a JPEG with dimensions for quoting.

## Engraving Capacity

- **Maximum sheet size:** up to 1300 x 900 mm

## Applications

3D laser engraving is ideal for projects that demand a premium, tactile finish — including branded signage, personalised portraits, awards, architectural panels, and memorial pieces. The dimensional quality of 3D engraving delivers a result that standard 2D engraving simply cannot match.
