## What Is Corflute?

Corflute is a fluted [polypropylene](/materials/polypropylene-sheet-rod) sheet that resembles corrugated cardboard in structure — outside walls separated by ribs. Also known as fluted poly or extruded twinwall plastic, it is the industry standard for lightweight, durable signage and display applications.
