## Perspex Pool Fence Panels — Your Complete Guide

If you own a pool in Queensland, you already know the rules are strict. Gold Coast City Council and the Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC) require compliant pool fencing — and non-compliance can result in fines of up to $20,000.

Perspex acrylic sheet has become one of the most popular materials for pool fence infill panels, and for good reason. This guide covers everything you need to know about using Perspex for your pool fencing.

### Why Perspex for Pool Fencing?

Perspex is a cast acrylic manufactured to the highest international standards. When used as pool fence infill panels, it delivers several advantages over traditional glass:

- **Up to 17 times stronger than glass** — significantly more impact-resistant and far less likely to shatter
- **Fraction of the weight** — easier to handle, transport, and install
- **UV resistant** — Perspex is engineered for long-term outdoor use in the harsh Australian climate without yellowing or becoming brittle
- **Crystal-clear optical clarity** — over 92% light transmission, comparable to glass
- **Cost-effective** — typically less expensive than glass panels of equivalent size
- **30-year warranty on clear Perspex** — a testament to the product's durability

### Recommended Thickness

For pool fence infill panels, we recommend:

- **3 mm** — suitable for standard residential panels where the span between posts is relatively narrow
- **4.5 mm** — recommended for wider spans or areas subject to wind loading
- **6 mm** — for maximum rigidity in exposed or high-wind locations

The right thickness depends on your panel dimensions and the specific requirements of your installation. Our team can advise on the best option for your setup.

### Perspex vs Polycarbonate for Pool Fencing

Both materials are excellent choices, but they serve slightly different needs:

| Feature | Perspex (Acrylic) | Polycarbonate (Lexan) |
|---|---|---|
| Impact strength vs glass | ~17x stronger | ~250x stronger |
| Light transmission | ~92% | ~88% |
| UV resistance | Excellent (inherent) | Requires UV coating |
| Scratch resistance | Good | Lower (softer surface) |
| Cost | Lower | Higher |
| Best for | Standard residential pool fencing | High-traffic or commercial settings |

For most residential pool fencing on the Gold Coast, Perspex is the material of choice. Polycarbonate is the better option where extreme impact resistance is required — such as commercial pool areas or properties near sports courts.

### Compliance Considerations

Your pool fence panels must comply with Australian Standard AS 1926.1 and any additional requirements set by your local council. Key points to be aware of:

- Panels must be securely fixed within the fencing framework
- There must be no footholds or handholds that a child could use to climb the fence
- Gate latches must be out of reach of young children
- The fence must be a minimum height as specified by your council

We recommend confirming the specific requirements with Gold Coast City Council or your local authority before ordering panels.
