## Material Properties Comparison

Choosing the right plastic starts with understanding the properties that matter for your application. Use this guide to compare key characteristics across our range of engineering plastics.

## Temperature Range

| Material | Min Temp | Max Continuous Temp |
|---|---|---|
| [PTFE](/materials/ptfe) | -200 degrees C | +260 degrees C |
| [UHMWPE](/materials/uhmwpe-sheet-rod) | -200 degrees C | +80 degrees C |
| [Polycarbonate](/materials/polycarbonate) | -40 degrees C | +125 degrees C |
| [Nylon](/materials/nylon-sheet-rod) | -30 degrees C | +100 degrees C |
| [HDPE](/materials/hdpe) | -45 degrees C | +100 degrees C |
| [Polypropylene](/materials/polypropylene-sheet-rod) | 0 degrees C | +100 degrees C |
| [Acetal](/materials/acetal-sheet-rod) | -40 degrees C | +80 degrees C |
| [PVC](/materials/pvc-sheet) (Rigid) | -10 degrees C | +60 degrees C |

## Impact Resistance (Best to Lowest)

1. **[Polycarbonate](/materials/polycarbonate)** — 250x stronger than glass
2. **[UHMWPE](/materials/uhmwpe-sheet-rod)** — Excellent, even at very low temperatures
3. **[Nylon](/materials/nylon-sheet-rod)** — Good toughness across temperature range
4. **[HDPE](/materials/hdpe)** — Good impact resistance
5. **[Acetal](/materials/acetal-sheet-rod)** — Moderate to good
6. **[PETG](/materials/petg-sheet)** — Excellent clarity with good impact
7. **[HIPS](/materials/hips)** — Good for thermoforming applications
8. **[PVC](/materials/pvc-sheet) (Rigid)** — Moderate
9. **[Polypropylene](/materials/polypropylene-sheet-rod)** — Good at room temperature, brittle when cold
