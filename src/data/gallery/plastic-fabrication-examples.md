## Plastic Fabrication Gallery

P&M Plastics has been fabricating custom plastic products on the Gold Coast for decades. This gallery showcases the breadth of our general fabrication capabilities — from simple cut-to-size panels to complex multi-component assemblies.

### Fabrication Capabilities

Our in-house capabilities include:

- **[CNC Laser Cutting](/services/cnc-laser-cutting)** — precision cuts in [acrylic](/materials/acrylic-sheet), [Perspex](/materials/perspex), [polycarbonate](/materials/polycarbonate), MDF, plywood, and thin metals with tolerances to fractions of a millimetre
- **[CNC Router Cutting](/services/cnc-router-cutting)** — intricate 2D and 3D machining across a wide range of sheet materials and engineering plastics
- **[CNC Water Jet Cutting](/services/cnc-water-jet-cutting)** — cuts virtually any material into any shape, including thick plastics, metals, stone, and composites
- **[CNC Vacuum Forming](/services/cnc-vacuum-forming)** — thermoforming over custom moulds for consistent production of three-dimensional parts
- **[Plastic Thermoforming](/services/plastic-thermo-forming)** — heat bending and shaping of thermoplastics using specialised ovens
- **Plastic Welding** — hot air and solvent welding for tanks, enclosures, and structural assemblies
- **[2D Laser Engraving and Etching](/services/2d-laser-engraving-etching)** — detailed surface marking, branding, and labelling
- **3D Laser Engraving** — textured, dimensional engraving for high-impact visual results

### Featured Projects

- **[Industrial](/industries/industrial) components** — [HDPE](/materials/hdpe) drive wheels, conveyor parts, machine guards, and pipe assemblies for mining and engineering clients
- **[Marine](/industries/marine) fittings** — driving consoles, windscreens, glove boxes, and deck hardware for OEM boat builders
- **[Signage](/industries/shopfitting-signage) and branding** — laser-cut logos, illuminated sign panels, and directional signage for retail and corporate environments
- **Architectural elements** — balustrade panels, room dividers, skylights, and decorative screening
- **Commercial products** — [sneeze guards](/products/sneeze-guards), display stands, food-grade components, and safety covers
- **[Automotive](/industries/automotive) parts** — dashboard trims, custom enclosures, and vehicle flooring

### Materials We Work With

Acrylic, Perspex, polycarbonate (Lexan), [PVC](/materials/pvc-sheet), HDPE, [polypropylene](/materials/polypropylene-sheet-rod), [PETG](/materials/petg-sheet), [HIPS](/materials/hips), ABS, [nylon](/materials/nylon-sheet-rod), [PTFE](/materials/ptfe), [UHMWPE](/materials/uhmwpe-sheet-rod), foam PVC, Corflute, MDF, plywood, aluminium composite panels, aluminium, steel, and stainless steel.
