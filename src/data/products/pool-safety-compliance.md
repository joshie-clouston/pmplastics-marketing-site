## PERSPEX and Polycarbonate Pool Fence Panels

As a homeowner, you have a legal responsibility to comply with City of Gold Coast Pool Fencing Regulations and Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC) Safety Standards. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to $20,000.

P&M Plastics supplies custom-cut pool fence panels in two premium materials, both compliant with local council and QBCC requirements.

### Acrylic Sheet (PERSPEX)

- **Up to 17 times stronger than glass**
- UV resistant for long-lasting outdoor performance
- Clear finish without the risk of shattering
- The most common material for pool fence guard panels
- **Recommended thickness**: 3mm for standard applications; 4.5mm for wider spans

### Polycarbonate Sheet (LEXAN)

- **Up to 250 times stronger than glass**
- Fire resistant
- Highly durable and flexible
- Best suited for high-traffic or commercial settings

### Custom Fabrication

- Panels cut to your exact specifications
- Pre-bent panels available for curved installations
- Compliant with Gold Coast City Council and QBCC regulations

### Why Upgrade to Acrylic or Polycarbonate?

Traditional glass pool fencing is heavy, expensive, and poses a shattering risk. [Acrylic](/materials/acrylic-sheet) and [polycarbonate](/materials/polycarbonate) panels deliver superior strength at a fraction of the weight, with no compromise on clarity or aesthetics.
