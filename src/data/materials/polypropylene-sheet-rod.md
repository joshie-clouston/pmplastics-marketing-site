## What Is Polypropylene?

Polypropylene (PP) is a lightweight, semi-crystalline thermoplastic with excellent chemical resistance and good mechanical properties. It is the lightest of all standard engineering plastics (SG 0.91), making it a cost-effective choice for chemical processing, tank construction, and general fabrication.

## Key Properties

- **Chemical resistance:** Excellent — resists most acids, alkalis, and solvents
- **Weight:** Lightest engineering plastic (specific gravity 0.91)
- **Fatigue resistance:** Good — excellent hinge properties
- **Weldability:** Weldable using hot air and extrusion welding
- **Impact strength:** Good at room temperature; reduces at low temperatures
- **Continuous use temperature:** 0 to 100 degrees C
- **Water absorption:** Negligible (0.01%)
- **Flammability:** Slow burning
- **Food safety:** FDA-approved grades available

## Chemical Resistance

**Compatible with:** Most acids, alkalis, alcohols, oils, and many organic solvents.

**Incompatible with:** Strong oxidising acids, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and aromatics. Avoid contact with copper and manganese.

## Available Sizes

### Sheet

**Standard sheet sizes:** 2000 x 1000 mm and 3000 x 1500 mm

**Thickness options:** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30 mm

**Colours:** Natural (translucent) and Grey

### Rod

**Colour:** Natural (translucent) and Grey

**Diameter range:** 10 mm to 200 mm in various standard lengths

## Applications

Polypropylene is commonly used for chemical tanks and vessels, tank linings, pump components, ventilation ducting, cutting boards, and orthotic devices.
