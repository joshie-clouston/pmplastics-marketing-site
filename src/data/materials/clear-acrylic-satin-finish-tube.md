## Clear Acrylic Satin Finish Tube

Clear acrylic satin finish tube is purpose-built for lighting applications — from pop-up displays to custom lighting effects. The satin finish diffuses light evenly, making it ideal for installations where LEDs are placed through the centre of the tube.

### Why Choose Satin Finish Tube?

- **Even light diffusion** — the satin finish softens and spreads light uniformly
- **LED compatible** — designed for LEDs threaded through the tube centre
- **Versatile** — suits both decorative and functional lighting
- **Acrylic construction** — lightweight, durable, and easy to fabricate

### Available Formats

Satin finish tubes are available in a range of diameters and lengths. Contact us for our detailed size chart or download our specification PDF.

### Manufacturing

Acrylic tubes are manufactured through two primary processes:

- **Extrusion** — suited for indoor applications
- **Continuous casting** — suited for applications requiring superior clarity
