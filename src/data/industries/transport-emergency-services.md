## Transport & Emergency Services

P&M Plastics' Research & Development division designs and manufactures [plastic components](/products/components) for a wide range of transport applications — with a focus on weight reduction, improved aesthetics, and significant cost savings compared to traditional materials like fibreglass or aluminium.

### Vehicles We Supply

- Trucks
- Buses and coaches
- Police vehicles
- Ambulances
- Fire trucks
- Battery-operated vehicles

### How We Work

We supply complete, assembled finished products direct to OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ready to be fitted to the vehicle. This streamlined approach reduces client labour costs and simplifies the production line.

Our team designs and replaces traditional components with [vacuum-formed](/services/cnc-vacuum-forming) plastic products that are more cost-effective, while incorporating metal sub-components for structural reinforcement where required. All fabrication and assembly is completed in-house, maintaining full quality control from start to finish.

### Why Plastic?

Vacuum-formed plastic components offer clear advantages for transport applications:

- **Lighter weight** — reduced vehicle mass improves fuel efficiency
- **Lower cost** — more economical than fibreglass or aluminium alternatives
- **Design flexibility** — complex shapes and custom finishes without expensive tooling changes
- **Durability** — UV-resistant and impact-resistant materials suited to harsh service conditions
