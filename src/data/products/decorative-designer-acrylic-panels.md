## Designer Acrylic Panels for Architectural and Interior Applications

Acrylic, also known as Perspex or Plexiglass, is a transparent thermoplastic that is often chosen as a light, durable, and cost-effective replacement for glass. Our decorative designer acrylic panels bring colour and visual impact to residential and commercial interiors.

### Why Choose Acrylic Panels?

- **Weather resistant** — suitable for both indoor and outdoor use
- **Easy to cut and shape** — readily fabricated to any design
- **Shatter-resistant** — far safer than glass in high-traffic areas
- **Economical alternative to polycarbonate** — premium look at a lower price point

### Available Colours

- White, ivory, and grey
- Blue, green, and amber
