## Perspex Handbag Base

Soft-based handbags tend to sag in the centre, losing their shape and making it harder to find your belongings. P&M Plastics manufactures custom Perspex inserts designed to prevent this sagging and keep your bag looking its best.

### How It Works

Provide the interior base dimensions of your handbag, and we manufacture a matching Perspex insert. The piece sits loosely at the bottom of the bag — no permanent installation required — making it simple to remove for cleaning.

### Features

- **Custom fit** — made to your handbag's exact interior dimensions
- **Safety first** — all edges and corners are radiused so there are no sharp edges
- **Easy maintenance** — remove, wipe clean, and replace in seconds
- **Clear Perspex** — discreet and lightweight

### Why It Works

A rigid Perspex base distributes the weight of your bag's contents evenly across the bottom, preventing the centre from bowing. This keeps your bag upright, organised, and looking new for longer.

Contact P&M Plastics on **07 5535 7544** to order your custom handbag base insert.
