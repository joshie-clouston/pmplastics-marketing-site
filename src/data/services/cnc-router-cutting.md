## Gold Coast CNC Router Cutting Services

CNC routers are used to cut a wide range of materials including wood, metals, plastics, and high-density foams. CNC stands for "computer numerical control" — we use computers and CAD software to cut consistent, intricate designs into materials for our clients.

P&M Plastics is privately owned and operated on the Gold Coast. Situated in Burleigh Heads, we offer CNC router cutting services to individuals and businesses and are happy to ship Australia-wide.

## Materials

Driven by CAD software that performs 2D and 3D machining, combined with auto multi-tool changing software and auto nesting programs, our routers cut a wide selection of materials:

- [HDPE](/materials/hdpe)
- [UHMWPE](/materials/uhmwpe-sheet-rod)
- [Acetal](/materials/acetal-sheet-rod)
- [Nylon](/materials/nylon-sheet-rod)
- MDF
- Aluminium and similar metals
- Copper
- Brass
- Plywood
- Aluminium Composite Material (ACM)
- All types of plastics and laminates

## Custom Designs

We offer a wide range of possibilities when it comes to router-cut products. Using CNC machines and CAD software with various depth and groove possibilities, we create custom designs including shapes, logos, letters, signs, and more.

For custom designs, our CNC router requires a vectored file such as EPS, AI, CDR, DXF, DWG, or IGS to operate. For quoting purposes, all we need is a JPEG or bitmap file with dimensions.

## Our Machines

P&M Plastics operates a range of versatile CNC router cutting machines:

- **Tekcel Multi Stage** — 4000 x 2000 mm
- **Tekcel 18 Multi Tool** — 3660 x 1830 mm
- **Tekcel 15 Multi Tool** — 3000 x 2000 mm
- **Multicam 10 Multi Tool** — 2500 x 1250 mm

With this range of machines, we handle both small and large jobs in any quantity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What are the advantages of CNC router cutting?**
CNC machines are efficient, safe, and cost-effective. They cut consistent shapes and create intricate designs, making router cutting particularly valuable for orders in larger quantities.

**What materials cannot be router cut?**
We do not recommend router cutting glass due to the risk of shattering. For similar results, clear [acrylic](/materials/acrylic-sheet) and other plastic materials are excellent alternatives.

**What types of wood can be cut?**
Nearly all types of wood can be CNC router cut, including derivatives such as MDF and plywood.

**Can PVC be router cut?**
Yes. For the most accurate, consistent results, hard plastics like [PVC](/materials/pvc-sheet) should be cut using solid carbide router tools.
