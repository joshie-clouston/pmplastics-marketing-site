## What Is Self-Adhesive Foam Tape?

Self-adhesive foam tape is a closed-cell foam strip with pressure-sensitive adhesive on one or both sides. It is used for sealing, cushioning, mounting, and vibration dampening across a wide range of applications — from glazing seals to sign mounting.

## Key Properties

- **Adhesive:** Pressure-sensitive — peel-and-stick application
- **Foam type:** Closed-cell — does not absorb water
- **Compression:** Conforms to irregular surfaces and fills gaps
- **Weather resistance:** Suitable for indoor and outdoor use
- **Vibration dampening:** Absorbs shock and vibration
- **Temperature resistance:** Suitable for normal Australian operating temperatures

## Available Options

### Single-Sided Tape
Adhesive on one side, foam on the other. Used for cushioning, gap sealing, and weather stripping.

### Double-Sided Tape
Adhesive on both sides. Used for permanent mounting of panels, signs, and lightweight components.

## Available Sizes

**Widths:** 6 mm, 9 mm, 12 mm, 18 mm, 25 mm, 50 mm

**Thicknesses:** 1.6 mm, 3 mm, 6 mm

**Roll lengths:** Various — typically 10 m and 20 m rolls

**Colours:** Black, White, Grey
