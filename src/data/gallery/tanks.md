## Custom Liquid Transport Tanks Gallery

P&M Plastics designs and manufactures custom plastic tanks for liquid transport, chemical storage, and industrial processing applications. Each tank is purpose-built to suit the specific requirements of the application, material compatibility, and installation environment.

### Types of Tanks

Our tank fabrication portfolio includes:

- **Chemical storage tanks** — welded PVC and polypropylene tanks for acids, alkalis, and corrosive liquids used in industrial and mining operations
- **Acid tank assemblies** — complete assemblies with fittings, pipe headers, and overflow systems for chemical processing facilities
- **Water transport tanks** — lightweight, durable tanks designed for vehicle-mounted liquid transport
- **Liquid dispensing tanks** — custom tanks with outlet fittings for controlled dispensing in commercial and industrial settings
- **Bunded containment systems** — secondary containment solutions to meet environmental compliance requirements

### Materials Used

- **PVC** — excellent chemical resistance, widely used for acid and alkali storage
- **HDPE (High Density Polyethylene)** — tough, UV-resistant, and suitable for a broad range of chemicals
- **Polypropylene** — high temperature resistance and superior chemical compatibility
- **Acrylic** — used where visual inspection of liquid levels is required

### Fabrication Methods

Tanks are manufactured using precision plastic welding, CNC router cutting, and custom fabrication techniques. All joins are tested for integrity before dispatch. We can fabricate tanks to virtually any shape or volume to suit your installation constraints.

### Industries Served

Our tanks are used across mining, water treatment, sewerage processing, car wash stations, agricultural operations, and industrial manufacturing.
