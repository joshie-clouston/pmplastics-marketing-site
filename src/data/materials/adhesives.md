## Plastic Adhesives

Choosing the right adhesive is critical to a strong, lasting bond. Different plastics require different bonding methods — from solvent cements that chemically weld surfaces together, to structural adhesives for load-bearing joints.

We stock a range of adhesives specifically formulated for plastic bonding and can advise on the best product for your application.

## Adhesive Types

### Solvent Cements

Solvent cements work by dissolving the surfaces of the plastic parts, allowing them to fuse together as the solvent evaporates. This creates a chemical weld that is often stronger than the parent material.

- **Acrylic cement:** For bonding [acrylic](/materials/acrylic-sheet) to acrylic — produces a clear, strong joint
- **PVC cement:** For bonding rigid [PVC](/materials/pvc-sheet) — commonly used in pipe and tank fabrication

### Two-Part Adhesives

Two-part (epoxy and methacrylate) adhesives are ideal for bonding dissimilar materials or where a gap-filling adhesive is required.

- **Epoxy adhesives:** High-strength structural bonds for most plastics and metals
- **Methacrylate adhesives:** Excellent for bonding acrylic, [polycarbonate](/materials/polycarbonate), and composites

### UV-Cure Adhesives

UV-cure adhesives set when exposed to ultraviolet light, producing a crystal-clear bond. Ideal for display and [signage](/industries/shopfitting-signage) work where appearance is critical.

### General-Purpose Adhesives

For non-structural applications, we stock general-purpose adhesives suitable for a wide range of plastics.

## Application Advice

Not sure which adhesive you need? Bring in your materials or describe your project and our team will recommend the right product. Proper surface preparation and joint design are just as important as adhesive selection — we can help with that too.
