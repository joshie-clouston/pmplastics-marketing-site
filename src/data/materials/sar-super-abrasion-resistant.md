## SAR Super Abrasion Resistant Acrylic Sheet

SAR is a hard-coated [acrylic](/materials/acrylic-sheet) material combining safety, optical clarity, and durability. A polysilicate coating is applied to an acrylic substrate, delivering 45 times the abrasion resistance of uncoated acrylic — while remaining half the weight of glass.

### Why Choose SAR?

- **45x abrasion resistance** — far outlasts standard acrylic in scratch-prone environments
- **5x stronger than glass** — impact and shatter-resistant
- **93% light transmission** — significantly clearer than [polycarbonate](/materials/polycarbonate) (66%) or bullet-resistant glass (55%)
- **Half the weight of glass** — simplifies installation and reduces structural requirements
- **On-site fabrication** — cut with standard power tools, retrofit into existing glass frames
- **Chemical resistant** — resists more chemicals than standard acrylic

### Available Sizes

| Sheet Size | Thicknesses |
|---|---|
| 3000 x 2000 mm | 3 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm |
| 2000 x 1500 mm | 3 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm |

### Applications

**Safety glazing** — schools, hospitals, bus shelters, skylights, sound barriers, zoo enclosures, machine guards

**Transport** — bus windows, [automotive](/industries/automotive) sunroofs, aircraft and limousine windows, [marine](/industries/marine) portholes and windshields

**Commercial and display** — merchandise cases, directory panels, picture framing

**Architectural** — frameless and semi-frameless balustrade systems
