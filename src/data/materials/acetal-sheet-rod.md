## What Is Acetal?

Acetal (also known by the trade name Delrin) is a semi-crystalline engineering thermoplastic with outstanding mechanical properties. It offers high strength, stiffness, and hardness combined with low friction and excellent wear resistance, making it one of the most widely used engineering plastics for precision machined components.

## Key Properties

- **Mechanical strength:** High tensile and flexural strength
- **Friction:** Low coefficient of friction — excellent for sliding applications
- **Machinability:** Excellent — machines to tight tolerances
- **Dimensional stability:** Good — minimal moisture absorption
- **Fatigue resistance:** High — withstands repeated loading
- **Water absorption:** Low (0.2%)
- **Continuous use temperature:** -40 to 80 degrees C
- **Specific gravity:** 1.41
- **Creep resistance:** Good under sustained loading

## Chemical Resistance

**Compatible with:** Weak acids, weak alkalis, alcohols, oils, greases, fuels, and most solvents.

**Incompatible with:** Strong acids, strong oxidising agents, and phenols.

**Food safety:** FDA-approved grades available.

## Available Sizes

### Sheet

**Standard sheet size:** 1000 x 500 mm and 1000 x 1000 mm

**Thickness options:** 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 mm

**Colours:** Natural (cream/white) and Black

### Rod

**Colour:** Natural (cream/white) and Black

**Diameter range:** 6 mm to 200 mm in various standard lengths

## Applications

Acetal is commonly used for gears and bearings, bushings and rollers, conveyor components, pump and valve parts, food processing equipment, and electrical insulators.
