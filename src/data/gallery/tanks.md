## Custom Liquid Transport Tanks Gallery

P&M Plastics designs and manufactures custom plastic tanks for liquid transport, chemical storage, and [industrial](/industries/industrial) processing applications. Each tank is purpose-built to suit the specific requirements of the application, material compatibility, and installation environment.

### Types of Tanks

Our tank fabrication portfolio includes:

- **Chemical storage tanks** — welded [PVC](/materials/pvc-sheet) and [polypropylene](/materials/polypropylene-sheet-rod) tanks for acids, alkalis, and corrosive liquids used in industrial and mining operations
- **Acid tank assemblies** — complete assemblies with fittings, pipe headers, and overflow systems for chemical processing facilities
- **Water transport tanks** — lightweight, durable tanks designed for vehicle-mounted liquid transport
- **Liquid dispensing tanks** — custom tanks with outlet fittings for controlled dispensing in commercial and industrial settings
- **Bunded containment systems** — secondary containment solutions to meet environmental compliance requirements

### Materials Used

- **PVC** — excellent chemical resistance, widely used for acid and alkali storage
- **[HDPE](/materials/hdpe) (High Density Polyethylene)** — tough, UV-resistant, and suitable for a broad range of chemicals
- **Polypropylene** — high temperature resistance and superior chemical compatibility
- **[Acrylic](/materials/acrylic-sheet)** — used where visual inspection of liquid levels is required

### Fabrication Methods

Tanks are manufactured using precision plastic welding, [CNC router cutting](/services/cnc-router-cutting), and custom fabrication techniques. All joins are tested for integrity before dispatch. We can fabricate tanks to virtually any shape or volume to suit your installation constraints.

### Industries Served

Our tanks are used across mining, water treatment, sewerage processing, car wash stations, agricultural operations, and industrial manufacturing.
