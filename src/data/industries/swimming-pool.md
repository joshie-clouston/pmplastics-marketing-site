## Swimming Pool Safety Products

P&M Plastics designs and manufactures safety covers for power outlets, switches, and taps located within swimming pool fenced areas — helping homeowners and builders comply with council regulations on the Gold Coast and across Australia.

### The Problem

Council swimming pool regulations require that power outlets, switches, and taps within pool fenced areas are fitted with protective covers. These covers must be installed at a 30-degree angle to the wall to prevent children from gaining a foothold on fences or accessing gate latches.

### Our Solution

We designed purpose-built safety covers constructed from **3 mm clear UV [polycarbonate](/materials/polycarbonate)** — an unbreakable, weather-resistant material that stands up to the harsh Australian outdoor environment.

#### Key Features

- **Unbreakable polycarbonate** — will not shatter or crack under impact
- **UV-resistant** — maintains clarity and strength in direct sunlight
- **30-degree angled design** — compliant with council pool fencing regulations
- **Easy wall mounting** — fits securely to brick, render, timber, and other common substrates
- **Clear material** — maintains visibility of outlets and switches for easy identification

### Applications

- Power outlet covers within pool fencing
- Light switch covers near pool areas
- Tap covers within fenced pool zones
- Any fixture requiring childproof protection near swimming pools

These covers are a simple, cost-effective way to bring your pool area into compliance. Available for purchase directly from our Burleigh Heads workshop or via enquiry.
