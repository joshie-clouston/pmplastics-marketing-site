## Material Properties Comparison

Choosing the right plastic starts with understanding the properties that matter for your application. Use this guide to compare key characteristics across our range of engineering plastics.

## Temperature Range

| Material | Min Temp | Max Continuous Temp |
|---|---|---|
| PTFE | -200 degrees C | +260 degrees C |
| UHMWPE | -200 degrees C | +80 degrees C |
| Polycarbonate | -40 degrees C | +125 degrees C |
| Nylon | -30 degrees C | +100 degrees C |
| HDPE | -45 degrees C | +100 degrees C |
| Polypropylene | 0 degrees C | +100 degrees C |
| Acetal | -40 degrees C | +80 degrees C |
| PVC (Rigid) | -10 degrees C | +60 degrees C |

## Impact Resistance (Best to Lowest)

1. **Polycarbonate** — 250x stronger than glass
2. **UHMWPE** — Excellent, even at very low temperatures
3. **Nylon** — Good toughness across temperature range
4. **HDPE** — Good impact resistance
5. **Acetal** — Moderate to good
6. **PETG** — Excellent clarity with good impact
7. **HIPS** — Good for thermoforming applications
8. **PVC (Rigid)** — Moderate
9. **Polypropylene** — Good at room temperature, brittle when cold
