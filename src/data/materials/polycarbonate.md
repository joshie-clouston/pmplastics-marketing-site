## What Is Polycarbonate?

Polycarbonate (trade names Lexan, Hyzod, Safeguard, Impax) is a high-performance engineering plastic with outstanding impact strength. It is 250 times stronger than glass and 30 times more resilient than [acrylic](/materials/acrylic-sheet), making it the go-to choice for safety glazing and high-impact applications.

## Key Properties

- **Impact resistance:** 250x stronger than glass; 30x more resilient than acrylic
- **Light transmission:** 82%–86%
- **Continuous use temperature:** 100–125 degrees C
- **Heat deflection temperature:** 135 degrees C (unreinforced)
- **Specific gravity:** 1.5
- **Flame retardancy:** Inherent — self-extinguishing
- **Electrical properties:** Good insulation performance
- **Acoustic performance:** Excellent sound dampening

## Limitations

- Poor resistance to alkalis and many organic chemicals (may cause stress cracking)
- Requires UV coating on both sides for weather protection

## Available Sizes

**Standard sheet size:** 1220 x 2440 mm (8 x 4 ft) — oversized sheets available on request.

**Thickness options:** 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, 4.5 mm, 6 mm, 9.5 mm, 12 mm

**Colours:** Clear, Opal, Light Grey Tint

## Applications

Polycarbonate is widely used for safety glazing, vandal-resistant barriers, machine guards, sight glasses, safety visors, electrical components, and architectural glazing.
