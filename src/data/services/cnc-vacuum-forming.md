## Gold Coast Vacuum Forming Services

P&M Plastics operates several specialised vacuum forming machines with a variety of applications, utilising different plate sizes. Each machine is controlled by CNC software to manage heaters, timing, and vacuum pressure — delivering consistent results across every production run.

## How Vacuum Forming Works

Vacuum forming is performed by heating a thermoplastic material until it reaches a pre-set melt flow index, at which point the material can be formed over a tool or mould using vacuum pressure. The material is clamped in position during forming to ensure dimensional accuracy.

## Our Equipment

We currently operate five vacuum forming machines:

| Machine | Heat Platen | Control | Capacity (mm) |
|---------|------------|---------|----------------|
| Waeco | Single | Manual | 1380 x 760 |
| Leading Edge | Single | CNC | 1500 x 1500 |
| Leading Edge | Twin | CNC | 2650 x 1830 |
| P&M Custom | Single | CNC | 3100 x 2000 |
| Maac | Twin | CNC | 2250 x 1250 |

## Materials

We vacuum form a range of thermoplastic materials, including:

- [Acrylic](/materials/acrylic-sheet)
- High Impact Styrene
- High Impact Acrylic
- Polyethylene
- ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)
- ASA (Acrylic Styrene Acrylonitrile)

## Tooling and Prototyping

Our in-house tooling capability means we can take your project from concept to production:

- **Prototypes** — wood or MDF tools manufactured in-house using our 3D [CNC routers](/services/cnc-router-cutting)
- **Production tooling** — tools manufactured from fibreglass or aluminium epoxy for long-run durability
- **Trimming** — jigs, fixtures, or our CNC Robot Trimmer are used for accurate component separation after forming

This end-to-end capability allows us to deliver fast prototype turnaround and seamless transition into full production.
